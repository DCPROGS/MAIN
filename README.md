# DCPROGS
The goal of DCPROGS is to provide a collection of tools for scientific research on ion channels. The package is derived from the DCPROGS suite (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dcpr95.html) and will consist of a Python port, algorithms writen in C++ and wrap of some Fortran code with ~30 years usage at University College London. The rationale is to preserve and cultivate these tools for future research applications.
