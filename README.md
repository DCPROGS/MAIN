# DCPROGS
The goal of DCPROGS is to provide a collection of tools for scientific research on ion channels. The package is derived from the DCPROGS suite and will consist of a Python port and wrap of Fortran code with ~30 years usage at University College London. The rationale is to preserve and cultivate these tools for future research applications.
